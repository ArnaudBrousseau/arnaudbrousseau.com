Going to Dijon this weekend I visited the Musée des Beaux-Arts. Not only is it
free but there are some incredible pieces exposed there. Authentic medieval
swords, weapons and armors and finely sculpted tombs of the last duke and
duchess of Burgundy.

One piece struck a debate among my friends and I: "La Chevauchée des Rois
Mages". A painting supposedly from 1460, by an anonymous painter only known as
"Maître des Déplorations de Sarnen".

According the museum this piece is oil on wood (if you get close you can see
the 5 pieces of woods quite distinctly). Size is 128cm high by 95cm wide.

Upon seeing "La Chevauchée des Rois Mages" for the first time I immediately
though "nah, can't be that old". Everything about it felt
contemporary. Its colors are bright. The shape of the horses, demeanor of the
monkey and body outlines of the three men feel closer to surrealism than Middle
Age or even Renaissance.

I learned afterwards that this painting was restored in 2001-2004. Here's a

to its official page on the Musée des Beaux-Arts' website.

I've also found a picture on an old version of their website of what the
painting looked like before. I've put them side-by-side for easier comparison.
Colors are quite different!

This of course explains part of the anachronism, but not all. Shapes were kept
the same of course! This anonymous painter in the middle of Switzerland in the
15th century was well ahead of his time!

Here's a link to a [full-size photo of the painting](/img/chevauchee_full_size.jpg)
that I took.
