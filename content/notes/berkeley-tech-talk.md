title: "Berkeley Tech Talk on Performance"
date: 2017-09-17

I went to Berkeley today to talk to a group of students about performance, why
it matters, and how Yelp as a company approaches it. Since Berkeley now teaches
Computer Science in Python and Yelp uses this language extensively I decided to
focus on Python profiling, then explained tracing and how this is used at Yelp,
and concluded with a word of caution against premature optimization and lack of
user-centered performance monitoring.

Here's a picture of the room before the event started:

It was a lot of fun to get to talk at Berkeley, thanks to the students and Yelp
for setting this up and making it happen!
