title: "UIUC Tech Talk On Modern Web Debugging"
date: 2013-10-10

I went to UIUC in October 2013 to meet students and tell them about Yelp
engineering opportunities. I took advantage of this opportunity to put together
some slides to give a talk about modern Web debugging.

As a Web developer this is hands down the domain in which I feel I've made the
most progress. Turns out being better at debugging makes you a lot more
productive too!

I talked about a whole bunch of things including: how to use a Web console, how
to chase down a bug in HTML, CSS or JS, how to write unit test in pure JS and
integration test in Selenium (with demos). I also touched on what test
automation tools were (mocha, buildbot, travisCI, etc.)

Interested in the slides?
[They're online](https://docs.google.com/a/yelp.com/presentation/d/1ng20bCc6ChlkRMPoycbivLM_fASvb4l4CmwTKv3WoKM/present)!

If you want to know more, checkout the [git
repo](https://github.com/ArnaudBrousseau/uiuc_tech_talk), it contains
everything including the demos, slides and code examples.

And here's a picture of that room full of UIUC students:
