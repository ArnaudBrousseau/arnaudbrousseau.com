title: "Personal Ethos and Values"

A great ex-colleague of mine [@solarkennedy](https://twitter.com/solarkennedy)
once gave a talk about engineering leadership and challenged the room, a group
of tech leads, to someday think hard and write down what their core values are.
I've been thinking about this on and off for a while, and I believe I'm ready to
start writing some things down.

# Engineering

* If you do something 3 times, think about writing it down (if it's a process),
  automating it or abstracting it (if it's code)
* Lack of tests is worse than technical debt. What I mean by "technical debt" is
  the usual: long functions, complex nested if/for/if/else/while loops, tangled
  logic. Getting rid of technical debt is generally easy with
  tests, and extremely hard without. Lack of tests organically produces
  hard-to-remove technical debt; good test coverage enables regular tech debt
  cleanups.
* I don't believe in TDD. But I believe in good automated tests. My philosophy:
  never test code manually. Test the code that you've written or modified with a
  new or existing **automated** test. Don't be religious about writing the
  test(s) first.
* Debuggers are vastly more efficient at finding bugs than print/log statements
  or manual tests. Invest in learning how to use them. Then use them.
* Engineering ownership is the most challenging thing to scale. "Ownership" is
  both "who do I talk to to modify X?" and "who fixes X when it misbehaves?".
* Processes aren't good or bad. They're either good or bad **fits**. The same
  applies to engineering tools (think: programming languages, frameworks,
  editors). When a change is warranted: focus on the *fit* and make it better.
* A well-communicated, agreed-upon solution beats a technically better one
  every time. Engineers tend to be introverts so knowing how to build coalitions
  and how to create/communicate (technical) roadmaps is like having super-powers.
* Performance optimizations made at the product level (changing the UI, tweaking
  the product requirements) have 10x more potential than optimizations made
  anywhere else for that particular product. Hence performance and
  product/design go hand-in-hand.
* Code is written first for other humans to read, then for machines to execute.
  Optimize for human reading speed first and for machine execution speed
  second.
* Software engineering is 1% writing code, 99% fixing it, tweaking it,
  releasing it, testing it, monitoring it, deprecating it.
* Scout rule: when modifying code, leave it cleaner than you found it! Related:
  "Be the change you want to see in the world" applies to code. Ask for
  forgiveness instead of permission when it comes to changing code.
* KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) > DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

# Life

* Everything lies on a spectrum. Look for both ends of it, play "devil's" advocate
  as much as you can.
* What defines you shapes your identity and also a set of blind spots. Look for
  how you talk about yourself to be aware of them.
* Comfort is a hardcore drug. Treat it like one, and expect withdrawal symptoms
  if you overuse it
* Feelings are (sometimes unconscious) choices. More evidently: actions are
  choices too. Take responsibility for both.
* The more money you have, the less important money should feel. Don't let money
  become more and more important instead; otherwise you give up one of the core
  benefits of having money.
* Education is at the core of everything we do. At the core of successes and at
  the core of failure.
* There is no "good" and "bad". Just people with different education, values and
  incentives.
* There is no afterlife. Enjoy this one while it lasts.
* God doesn't exist, or at least not in the form described by religions. So make
  the most of life or don't, nobody is judging. Pressure off.

# Love

Probably a lot of things to say on the topic but I've come to disagree with the
standard European Romantic approach. Here's a poem (by Kahlil Gibran) which
reflects my updated view:

> Let there be spaces in your togetherness  
> And let the winds of the heavens dance between you  
> [...]  
> Sing and dance together and be joyous, but let each one of you be alone  
> Even as the strings of a lute are alone though they quiver with the same music.  
> Give your hearts, but not into each other's keeping.  
> [...]  
> And stand together, yet not too near together:  
> For the pillars of the temple stand apart,  
> And the oak tree and the cypress grow not in each other's shadow  

For that reason I find the term of "partner" quite fitting to the idea of a
long-lasting relationship.
