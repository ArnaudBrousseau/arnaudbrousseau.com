<p class="story">
This mini app produces "valid" Satoshi signatures. More specifically, it
produces a message hash and a signature that verify when checked against the
public key for the genesis Bitcoin address.
</p>

<p class="story">
Of course this isn't real: I do not possess the private key behind the Bitcoin
genesis address! This app constructs a valid hash and associated ECDSA signature
with simple math (<a href="https://github.com/RustCrypto/traits/issues/1323#issuecomment-1587803872" target="_blank" rel="noopener">see details here</a>).
</p>

<p class="story">
We cannot construct a valid **message** to verify
against because it'd require us to find a valid pre-image for that constructed
hash. And that would mean breaking sha256.
</p>

<p class="story">
The lesson here: ECDSA is constructed with a hash function acting as a Random
Oracle. If this assumption is violated (in this case, I'm choosing the hash so
it's definitely not random!) ECDSA breaks catastrophically; <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature_forgery#Existential_forgery"
rel="noopener" target="_blank">existential forgery attacks</a> become trivial
</p>

<p class="story">
This is an easy mistake to make when verifying signature. When verifying an
ECDSA signature, a verifier **must** compute the message hash themselves.
Otherwise they're not verifying anything of value,as this mini-demo
demonstrates. I'm clearly not Satoshi!
