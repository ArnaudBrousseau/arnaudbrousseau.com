<h2 id="what-is-devicepixelratio-">What is devicePixelRatio?</h2>
<p>&quot;devicePixelRatio&quot; is a JavaScript property used to determine the pixel density of a device.</p>
<h2 id="why-does-that-matter-">Why does that matter?</h2>
<p>As a web developer working on a mobile product (disclaimer: I work for Yelp on
the mobile site team), I care a lot about how websites are displayed on mobile
devices.
Very often we fallback to JS to serve the best experience for each device, and
there are a couple of areas where JS is required if you want to take advantage
of the new display capabilities.</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Responsive images
Example: <a href="http://menacingcloud.com/?c=highPixelDensityDisplays">http://menacingcloud.com/?c=highPixelDensityDisplays</a></p>
</li>
<li><p>Canvas based interaction

</li>
<li><p>Many other reasons including image loading, browser height sniffing, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
