                    Bloomster is my start-up venture. 
                    We are a small team of 3 people. We went from the initial idea to the writing of a contest-winning business plan.
                    We also had the amazing opportunity to go to ESCP (a leading French business school) and pitch our idea there.<br/>
                    Needless to say that Bloomster has been an amazing experience. Did we launch? No. Should we launch? Probably.
                    Will we launch? We'll see! :)<br/>

                    Their website needed to be rebuilt. This project had several components that needed to interact with each other:
                    website, forum, blog, online subscription system, ticket service for MU matches, and an admin section to manage the whole website.<br/>
                    The final architecture is built with a mix between wordpress-base website and blog, PHP custom code for the management system, and PHPBB to power the forum.

                    This car-sharing application was an attempt to reduce the cost of going home for students:<br/>
                    some students have a car and want to share costs, others don't want to pay the full price of a train ticket.
                    That's exactly where this app came into play.<br/>
                    The car-sharing application is powered by PHP on the server, without any framework. 
                    On the client side, it makes heavy use of JavaScript and interacts with the server asynchronously, for a fast user experience.

                    Georges Duquin is a French author and painter.
                    <br/>I met him as a complete anonymous stranger in the train one day, and we ended up talking about art, literature...and websites. He needed a new one, so I decided to take on this project.
                    <br/>I took advantage of it to learn 3 new things: how to use Twitter Bootstrap, how to use Perch (a very tiny CMS), and how to resist the urge to fire Photoshop when designing web interfaces. That's right, this project was designed in the browser from the beginning to the end.

                    This page was built for a special occasion: the last party organised by the student office I was part of, THE LAST ONE.<br/>
                    The main goal of this page was to promote the party both inside and outside the campus. It had to be a big party right? :)<br/>
                    I started with the PSD of the official flyer, and had to imagine how to adapt it to the web medium.
                    Another interesting part of this work was the implementation of an online system
                    to book the tickets for the party, secured via Paypal. (closed by now)<br/>

                    This website is the first real-world project I’ve been working on.
                    The BDE (Student Office) of my engineering school needed a webmaster,
                    and a cool website to be able to put all the information online.<br/>
                    I built this website from scratch : design, code, interactions,...<br/>
                    That was an amazing experience. The most interesting part about this website was the feedback from the users,
                    i.e the 800 students who were using it for almost 2 years.<br/>
