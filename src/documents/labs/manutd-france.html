<p class="story">
    Manchester United France is the official association for the French MU supporters.<br/>
    Their website needed to be rebuilt. This project had several components that needed to interact with each other:
    website, forum, blog, online subscription system, ticket service for MU matches, and an admin section to manage the whole website.<br/>
    The final architecture is built with a mix between wordpress-base website and blog, PHP custom code for the management system, and PHPBB to power the forum.
