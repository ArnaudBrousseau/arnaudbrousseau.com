<p class="story">
    Georges Duquin is a French author and painter.<br>
    I met him as a complete anonymous stranger in the train one day, and
    we ended up talking about art, literature...and websites. He needed a new
    one, so I decided to take on this project.<br>
    I took advantage of it to learn 3 new things: how to use Twitter
    Bootstrap, how to use Perch (a very tiny CMS), and how to resist the urge
    to fire Photoshop when designing web interfaces. That's right, this project
    was designed in the browser from the beginning to the end.
