<p class="story">
    This page was built for a special occasion: the last party organised by the student office I was part of, THE LAST ONE.<br/>
    The main goal of this page was to promote the party both inside and outside the campus. It had to be a big party right? :)<br/>
    I started with the PSD of the official flyer, and had to imagine how to adapt it to the web medium.
    Another interesting part of this work was the implementation of an online system
    to book the tickets for the party, secured via Paypal. (closed by now)<br/>
