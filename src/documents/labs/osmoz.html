<p class="story">
    This website is the first real-world project Iâ€™ve been working on.
    The BDE (Student Government Office) of my engineering school needed a webmaster,
    and a cool website to be able to put some information online.<br/>
    I built this website from scratch : design, code, interactions,...<br/>
    That was an amazing experience. The most interesting part about this
    website was the feedback from users: more than 800 students were using the
    site for almost 2 years.<br/>
