<p class="story">
    Bloomster is my start-up venture.  
    We were a small team of 3 people. We went from the initial idea to the writing of a contest-winning business plan.
    We also had the amazing opportunity to go to ESCP (a leading French business school) and pitch our idea there.<br/>
    Needless to say that Bloomster has been an amazing experience. Did we launch? No. Should we launch? Probably.
    Will we launch? We'll see! :)<br/>
