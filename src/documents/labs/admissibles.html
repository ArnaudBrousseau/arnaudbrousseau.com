<p class="story">
    This website has been used by more than 2000 students for 2 months.<br/>
    I was in charge of the full development of the website,
    and chose to be compliant with the graphic aspect of my school's main website.<br/>
    The main components I had to build for this project: online form for room reservation, online help, blog.
