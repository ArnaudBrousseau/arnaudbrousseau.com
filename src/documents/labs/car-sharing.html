<p class="story">
    This car-sharing application was an attempt to reduce the cost of going home for students:<br/>
    some students have a car and want to share costs, others don't want to pay the full price of a train ticket.
    That's exactly where this app came into play.<br/>
    The car-sharing application is powered by PHP on the server, without any framework. 
    On the client side, it makes heavy use of JavaScript and interacts with the server asynchronously, for a fast user experience.
