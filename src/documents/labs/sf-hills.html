    Tired of finding hills on your way when walking/biking in San Francisco?<br>
    <br>
    I made this webpage/app for you then!<br>
    I built it by scraping (a bit) Google Maps to have an altitude
    heatmap and visualize the hills more easily. Go optimize your walks, runs and
    bike rides!<br>
    <br>
    If you're interested further:<br>
