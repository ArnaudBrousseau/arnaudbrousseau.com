    This website has been created to promote the associative life on my campus.<br/>
    All design and code are done by myself, except the homepage illustration (by Jeremy Ouanounou).<br/>
    This website is fully editable since it is powered by Wordpress,
    so that anyone can take over the editing of the site after me.<br/>
