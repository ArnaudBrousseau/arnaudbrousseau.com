<p class="story">
    This small app/website is a simple visualization of the traveling
    accomplished in 2018. To make things a bit interesting I tried to reduce
    the use of frameworks and libraries to a bare minimum.<br/>
    <br/>
    The background world map is generated from raw, open data from <a
      href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/" rel="noopener"
      target="_blank">NaturalEarthData</a>. The data is stored in a Google
    spreadsheet, and pulled at build time though a simple Python script (which
    uses Google's API). The visualization itself is based on barebone HTML. The
    styling is done through CSS, and the interactivity comes from SVG,
    JavaScript and SMIL.<br/>
    <br/>
    Special care has been given to browser compatibility and progressive
    enhancement. Even if your browser/device doesn't support SVG at all you
    should still be able to see a table with the raw data. Better than a blank
    page don't you think? Feel free to take a look at the code <a href="https://github.com/ArnaudBrousseau/travel2018/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> here on Github</a>.
