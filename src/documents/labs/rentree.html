<p class="story">
    Back in 2009, I created a web application to handle the BDE suscriptions of students (about 400 each year),
    and to manage data such as phone numbers, address, etc. <br/>
    No framework were used, I did all the code (backend and frontend) myself.<br/>
    The use of this app saved us a lot of time and the overall management of the association was greatly improved.
