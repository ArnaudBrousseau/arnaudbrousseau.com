I was given the opportunity to give a lecture to a group of Berkeley students
in November 2013:
- Audience: small group of 40 grad students
- Speakers: [Jon Madden](https://twitter.com/hyr0) and I spoke, one hour each
- Context: guest speaker in [Jim Blomo's WEBARCH253](https://github.com/jblomo/webarch253)
- Subject: the Mobile Web
- Slides: [go read'em!](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ArnaudBrousseau/mobile-web-lecture-berkeley/master/mobile_web_berkeley.pdf)

The experience was fantastic. I was nervous at first but it went better than I
expected. You can find the slides and some code samples for this class online:
It's all [on my personal Github](https://github.com/ArnaudBrousseau/mobile-web-lecture-berkeley)!
