I'd like to do a bit of a retrospective on my experience interviewing for
different companies at the end of 2018.

Questions that would be good to answer:

* What made some processes good? Bad?
* What are some outdated interviewing tips?
* What's worked well for me? What would I do better next time?
* What are common themes across all interview processes?
