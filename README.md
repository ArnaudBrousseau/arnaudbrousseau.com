## http://arnaudbrousseau.com | Repo
This contains what's hosted at [arnaudbrousseau.com](http://arnaudbrousseau.com)

The site used to be a simple static HTML page. I decided to switch over to
[DocPad](http://docpad.org).

## Things to do, still
[x] Port labs section to new site
[ ] Audit copy across the site
[ ] Audit links in content and make them point to the right things
[ ] Make menu links work correctly in notes/labs pages
[ ] Put the damn thing in production already!
[ ] Redirect old x61 to new site
